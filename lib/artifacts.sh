# RepoLens — Human-facing triage artifact generators
# Renders the post-run Markdown artifacts under logs/<run-id>/final/ from the
# finding registry final/findings.jsonl (schema: docs/finding-registry-schema.md).
# This file only RENDERS; it never builds or mutates the registry. Sourced,
# never executed directly. Pure: function-only, no top-level side effects, no
# global mutation, safe under `set -uo pipefail`.
#
# Self-contained: the inclusion predicate and risk ordering are done inside jq
# so this file can be sourced alone. lib/risk.sh::finding_risk_score and
# lib/core.sh::severity_rank encode the equivalent shared formula; we do not
# depend on them landing first (matches the defensive discipline in ledger.sh /
# dedupe.sh). Wiring into repolens.sh finalize is a separate issue.
set -uo pipefail

# generate_todo_md <findings_jsonl> <out_file>
#   Renders the "act on these now" list to <out_file> as Markdown, one entry per
#   actionable finding showing severity, type, primary_location and (when present)
#   a link to its markdown_path. Reads the JSON-Lines registry with `jq -s`
#   (slurp) so the ordering spans every record.
#
#   INCLUSION PREDICATE (research "Reading B" — the recommended/owner design):
#     include  <=>  status == "new"
#                   AND NOT (confidence is a number strictly below THRESHOLD)
#     - THRESHOLD = 0.5 (the lib/risk.sh neutral midpoint), comparison inclusive:
#       confidence >= 0.5 is kept; an explicit number below 0.5 is excluded. To
#       tighten (e.g. drop "medium" too) a reviewer bumps this single constant.
#     - status == "new" IS the proof gate. The validation classifier (#334) and
#       dedupe (#335) demote weak / negative / duplicate findings OUT of "new",
#       so a record still "new" is confirmed and validation-not-negative. We
#       therefore honor the issue's "positive validation" half THROUGH status and
#       deliberately do NOT crack open the opaque `validation` object (its schema
#       ownership lives with the validation-hints agent).
#     - an UNSCORED confidence (null / absent / non-numeric) is KEPT (neutral),
#       mirroring lib/risk.sh's 0.5 default: unscored findings must not be buried.
#       This is load-bearing today, when `confidence` is null for every record.
#     - the status match is EXACT ("newish" and other unknown statuses do not
#       pass); this also excludes needs-validation / likely-false-positive /
#       duplicate.
#
#   ORDERING: severity rank desc (critical>high>medium>low; unknown last), then
#   confidence desc (null treated as the 0.5 neutral midpoint), then id ascending
#   as a stable tiebreak so output is byte-identical across runs (no timestamps).
#
#   RENDERING is defensive (every field below is null/empty for records emitted
#   today): null/empty type or primary_location renders as an em dash, never the
#   literal "null"; a null/empty markdown_path emits NO link (never a broken
#   "[...]()"). Fields are emitted verbatim by jq, so a title containing
#   backticks / $() / pipes is data, never shell-evaluated.
#
#   EMPTY / MISSING INPUT: a missing or unreadable input path returns 2 and
#   writes nothing (no crash). A present-but-empty or all-excluded registry
#   writes a valid file with a "no actionable findings" note and returns 0.
#
#   Pure apart from the documented write of <out_file> (atomic tmp+mv). Returns
#   0 on success, 2 on bad/unreadable input, 1 on a render/IO failure.

#   type, primary_location, (when present) a link to its markdown_path, and a

#   the ordering spans every record. Sibling of generate_todo_md; the two lists
#   together must lose no non-duplicate finding through the cracks.
#
#   INCLUSION PREDICATE — the complement of generate_todo_md's actionable set
#   over NON-DUPLICATE findings, unioned with two validation-derived reasons.
#   A finding is included iff status != "duplicate" AND any of:
#     P1  status == "needs-validation"          -> reason "needs validation"
#           (the validation classifier #334 flagged it for confirmation)
#     P2  status == "likely-false-positive"     -> reason "likely false positive"
#           DESIGN CALL: INCLUDED. TODO requires status == "new", so a
#           non-duplicate likely-false-positive is NOT actionable and IS in the
#           complement — a human confirms the probable-FP call rather than it
#           silently vanishing. (Excluding it would leave a gap between the two
#           lists; we keep them an exact complement.)
#     P3  confidence is a number strictly below THRESHOLD -> reason "low
#           confidence (<value>)". THRESHOLD = 0.5 and the (confidence|type) ==
#           "number" guard are IDENTICAL to generate_todo_md's: TODO keeps
#           unscored (neutral) + >= 0.5; NEEDS_REVIEW takes the explicit-low
#           leftovers. Keeping this constant in lockstep is the single highest-
#           risk correctness property — drift creates a coverage gap or overlap.
#     P4  validation.suggested_validation names an external scanner -> reason
#           "needs external scanner". Keys off the load-bearing escalation phrase
#           "needs external scanner" (prompts/_base/audit.md), matched
#           case-insensitively. This can surface an OTHERWISE-actionable finding
#           (status new, high confidence) that simply cannot be confirmed locally.
#     P5  validation.contradictory == true -> reason "contradictory validation".
#
#   P4/P5 inspect the opaque `validation` object (owned by the validation-hints
#   agent, #317/#332/#334/#345) via FORWARD-COMPATIBLE, DEFENSIVE heuristics:
#   they degrade to no-match on today's empty `{}` / a missing or non-object
#   value, and this function does NOT define the validation schema. The
#   duplicate guard is top-level so it wins over P3 (a low-confidence duplicate
#   belongs to the DUPLICATES artifact, a separate issue), and `status` being
#   single-valued means it cleanly removes duplicates from every predicate.
#
#   REASONS: each matched predicate's label is collected (a finding may match
#   several) from the SAME predicates that gate inclusion — single source of
#   truth, so the printed reason never drifts from why the entry was kept.
#
#   ORDERING: severity rank desc (critical>high>medium>low; unknown last), then
#   confidence desc (null treated as the 0.5 neutral midpoint), then id ascending
#   as a stable tiebreak so output is byte-identical across runs (no timestamps).
#

# generate_duplicates_md <findings_jsonl> <out_file>
#   Renders the "N lenses converged on the same finding" list to <out_file> as
#   Markdown, one section per MERGED GROUP: the canonical finding (severity, type,
#   primary_location and, when present, a link to its markdown_path) followed by
#   the OTHER lenses that also reported it (its `also_reported_by` list). Reads the
#   JSON-Lines registry with `jq -rs` (slurp) so ordering spans every record.
#   Sibling of generate_todo_md / generate_needs_review_md; renders only — it never
#   builds or mutates the registry.
#
#   MERGED-GROUP PREDICATE (research "Reading A" — the recommended/owner design):
#     include  <=>  `also_reported_by` is a NON-EMPTY array.
#     - That record IS the canonical (the synthesize step attaches
#       `also_reported_by` only to the canonical of a group), and its array already
#       enumerates every OTHER reporter. The reporter count is therefore
#       1 + (also_reported_by | length).
#     - `duplicate_group` is the section's group identity (shown as a "Group:" line
#       when present), but grouping NEVER depends on its value — so a null / missing
#       / non-string `duplicate_group` cannot crash the generator and the literal
#       "null" never leaks (it is rendered through the same defensive path).
#     - This is robust to today's data: `also_reported_by` is not yet carried into
#       findings.jsonl (the manifest->registry build drops it), so today every
#       record degrades to a singleton, yielding ZERO groups and the clean
#       empty-state path. The renderer lights up automatically once the
#       carry-through lands — no code change here. This mirrors how
#       generate_needs_review_md treats the opaque `validation` object: a
#       missing / null / wrong-typed value degrades to no-match, never a crash.
#
#   SINGLETONS — EXCLUDED (the documented rule). DUPLICATES.md is ABOUT
#   convergence; a singleton has nothing to merge and already appears in TODO.md /
#   NEEDS_REVIEW.md. A record with no / empty / non-array `also_reported_by` is a
#   singleton and is excluded by definition (never rendered, never an empty link).
#
#   Each `also_reported_by[]` element is { "lens": <id>, "domain": <id>,
#   "markdown_path": <path> } (one per non-canonical contributor; markdown_path may
#   be ""). Rendered "<domain>/<lens>" with an optional link when markdown_path is
#   non-empty.
#
#   ORDERING: severity rank desc (critical>high>medium>low; unknown last), then
#   confidence desc (null treated as the 0.5 neutral midpoint), then duplicate_group
#   then id ascending as a stable tiebreak so output is byte-identical across runs
#   (no timestamps).
#
#   RENDERING is defensive (mirrors the siblings): null/empty severity/type/
#   primary_location/domain/lens render as an em dash, never the literal "null"; a
#   null/empty markdown_path (canonical OR contributor) emits NO link (never a
#   broken "[...]()"). Fields are emitted verbatim by jq, so a title containing
#   backticks / $() / pipes is data, never shell-evaluated.
#
#   EMPTY / MISSING INPUT: a missing or unreadable input path returns 2 and writes
#   nothing (no crash). A present-but-empty or all-singleton registry writes a valid
