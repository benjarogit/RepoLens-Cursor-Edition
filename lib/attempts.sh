# RepoLens — per-invocation attempt record (issue #371).
#
# A run lives at `logs/<run-id>/` and survives `--resume` by reusing the SAME
# dir. Completion state persists in `logs/<run-id>/.completed` (append-only),
# but nothing records the SEPARATE invocations ("attempts") that touched the
# run: when each pass started/stopped, why it stopped, or how many lenses it
# completed. This module writes that audit trail to
# `logs/<run-id>/attempts.json` — a JSON array, one entry appended per
# invocation (fresh start OR `--resume`).
#
# Two functions:
#   attempts_begin <log_base>                       — called once near run-id
#       resolution; records started_at + a baseline .completed line count to a
#       transient `.attempt-start` marker.
#   attempts_finalize <log_base> <status> <why> <exit_code>
#       — appends one attempt entry atomically (temp file + mv).
#
# Each attempt entry (issue #375 enriched the #371 base for triage):
#   attempt_id                    monotonic 1-based int (= array length + 1)
#   started_at                    UTC +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ (.attempt-start marker)
#   finished_at                   UTC +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ (at finalize)
#   status                        REPOLENS_FINAL_STATE: finished / finished-empty
#                                 / failed / interrupted / rate-limit-pending
#   why_stopped                   the stopped_reason from summary.json, or a
#                                 sentinel fallback (rate-limit / agent-no-progress
#                                 / systemic-failure / interrupted-<signal>), or ""
#   lenses_completed_this_attempt lenses completed during THIS attempt (delta =
#                                 current .completed line count - baseline at
#                                 attempts_begin), clamped at >= 0. Answers "what
#                                 did THIS pass complete", which a cumulative
#                                 snapshot cannot.
#   lenses_completed_total        cumulative .completed line count at finalize —
#                                 "how far is the WHOLE run", across all attempts.
#   exit_code                     the process exit code this attempt is about to
#                                 exit with, as a JSON number; null when no exit
#                                 code is passed (e.g. a finalize that predates
#                                 the exit-code resolution).
#
# The write is additive and strictly non-fatal: every failure path logs a
# warning and returns 0 so an attempts-write failure never changes the run's
# exit code. Guarded by `command -v jq`. A corrupt/unparseable attempts.json is
# NEVER reset to [] (that would silently drop prior attempts) — we warn and
# skip the append instead. Pattern mirrors lib/result_pointer.sh (#308).

# _attempts_completed_count <log_base> — print the number of lenses recorded in
# <log_base>/.completed (one lens id per line). 0 if the file is absent or
# unreadable. Always prints a non-negative integer.
