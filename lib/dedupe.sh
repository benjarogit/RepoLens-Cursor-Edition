# RepoLens — Duplicate-group dedupe helpers
# Foundation of the dedupe-agent family (#316 canonical selection -> #322
# matching -> #335 marking -> #353 thresholds -> #343 --local -> #328
# also_reported_by[]). This file SELECTS the canonical record for a group (#316)
# and provides the near-duplicate MATCH predicates (#322); it never mutates
# records, builds the registry, or renders artifacts. Sourced, never executed
# directly. Pure: function-only, no global mutation, safe under
# `set -uo pipefail`.
#
# DEPENDENCY: reuses severity_rank / severity_normalize from lib/core.sh — do
# NOT reimplement severity handling. Callers must `source lib/core.sh` before
# this file. The #322 match predicate additionally reuses the title-similarity
# primitives (_synthesize_normalize_title / _synthesize_title_ngrams /
# _synthesize_jaccard_x10000) from lib/synthesize.sh — do NOT reimplement them.
set -uo pipefail

# _dedupe_is_match reuses the title-similarity primitives from lib/synthesize.sh.
# Source it on demand so this file works standalone (and from its test); when
# repolens.sh has already sourced synthesize.sh the guard is a cheap no-op.
# synthesize.sh transitively sources core.sh, so this also satisfies the
# severity_* dependency above. No top-level side effect beyond loading helpers.

# _dedupe_pick_canonical <json_array> [id_field=cluster_id]
#   Given a JSON array of finding records belonging to ONE duplicate group,
#   prints the id of the single CANONICAL record on stdout (one line).
#   Deterministic selection rule, applied in order:
#     1. highest severity   (severity_rank, lib/core.sh — NOT reimplemented)
#     2. highest confidence  (numeric; missing/null/unparseable = lowest)
#     3. lexicographically smallest id  (stable tiebreak; order-independent)
#
#   id_field defaults to "cluster_id" so it works on final/manifest.json today;
#   pass "id" for final/findings.jsonl records. Because id is unique within a
#   group, the id tiebreak makes the ordering total -> output is independent of
#   input array order (jq / parallel-collection order is not guaranteed stable).
#
#   Returns non-zero and prints nothing on empty / non-array / invalid input.
#   Pure: no side effects, no globals, no model. Never mutates the input.
#
#   NOTE: this deliberately does NOT use the 0.5 missing-confidence default from
#   _risk_confidence_normalize (lib/risk.sh). That default is a neutral midpoint
#   for *risk scoring* (so unscored findings aren't buried); here the contract is
#   the OPPOSITE — missing/unparseable confidence must rank LOWEST for tiebreak
#   ordering. A `has_conf` tier (present > missing) enforces that regardless of
#   numeric magnitude, including legitimately negative confidence values.

# _dedupe_location_key <record_json>
#   Derives a normalized, comparable location string from whatever location

#
#   SOURCE PRECEDENCE (first non-empty wins; documented contract):
#     1. .primary_location          (forward-looking findings.jsonl field; a
#                                     "path:line" string when present)
#     2. first non-empty .suspect_files[]        (cluster-rule field; may be
#                                                  present on some records)
#     3. first non-empty .source_finding_paths[] (always present on valid
#                                                  manifest records, but a WEAK
#                                                  cross-domain signal — lens
#                                                  output paths differ per lens)
#     4. else the empty string                   (no crash; deterministic)
#
#   NORMALIZATION applied to the chosen raw value (so the same file keys equal
#   regardless of surface form):
#     - trim surrounding whitespace
#     - lowercase
#     - backslashes -> forward slashes
#     - collapse duplicate slashes
#     - strip a leading "./"
#     - drop a trailing ":<line>" (and optional ":<col>") suffix — same file,
#       different line, keys the same ("drop the line", not bucket)
#
#   Deterministic and total: missing/null location fields, a non-object record,
#   or invalid JSON all yield the empty key. NEVER errors the pipeline (always
#   returns 0). Pure: no side effects, no globals, no model. Never mutates input.

# _dedupe_is_match <record_a_json> <record_b_json>
#   Exit-code predicate (idiomatic bash): returns 0 when the two finding
#   records are near-duplicates, non-zero otherwise. Use as:
#       if _dedupe_is_match "$a" "$b"; then ... ; fi
#
#   Two records MATCH when EITHER:
#     (1) title Jaccard similarity >= DEDUPE_TITLE_SIM_PRIMARY   (title alone)
#     (2) both location keys are non-empty AND equal, AND title Jaccard
#         similarity >= DEDUPE_TITLE_SIM_SECONDARY               (same file +

#
#   The match is CROSS-DOMAIN by design: .domain is never compared. Two records
#   from different lenses/domains that point at the same file with similar
#   wording therefore match (the "Empty-CN mTLS" case).
#
#   Title similarity reuses the existing primitives from lib/synthesize.sh
#   (_synthesize_normalize_title -> _synthesize_title_ngrams ->
#   _synthesize_jaccard_x10000); location uses _dedupe_location_key above.
#
#   Thresholds are module-level defaults, env-overridable (so #353 tuning and
#   tests can pin them without code changes), expressed as Jaccard x10000 and
#   resolved through _dedupe_resolve_sim_threshold (#353): non-numeric/negative
#   overrides fall back to the default with a log_warn (never crash); numeric
#   values > 10000 pass through as "effectively disabled" sentinels.
#     DEDUPE_TITLE_SIM_PRIMARY    default 8500 (0.85) — aligns with the existing
#                                 validate_manifest title bar (shared knob).
#     DEDUPE_TITLE_SIM_SECONDARY  default 6000 (0.60) — lower bar that only
#                                 applies once location agrees.
#   Comparison is inclusive (>=), per the issue.
#
#   GUARD: two empty location keys are NOT a location match — equality of keys
#   only counts when BOTH are non-empty. Without this, every location-less pair
#   would collapse at the lower threshold. Pure: no side effects, no model.
