# RepoLens — Human Mode bucketing helper
# Classifies the finding registry (final/findings.jsonl, schema:
# docs/finding-registry-schema.md) into the 5 noise-budget buckets that the
# --human-review digest renders. This file ONLY classifies + selects the
# ranking key; it renders no Markdown, groups no themes, and does no held-back
# accounting (those are separate issues). Sourced, never executed directly.
# Pure: function-only, no top-level side effects, no global mutation, safe under
# `set -uo pipefail`.
#
# Self-contained: the bucket predicates and risk ordering are done inside a
# single `jq -s` (slurp) pass so this file can be sourced alone, mirroring
# lib/artifacts.sh. lib/risk.sh::finding_risk_score and lib/core.sh::severity_rank
# encode the equivalent shared formula (severity_rank desc, then confidence desc
# with null treated as the 0.5 neutral midpoint, then id ascending as a stable
# tiebreak); we inline that ordering here rather than calling them per-record so
# we do not depend on them being sourced first. The bucket-2 type matching mirrors
# lib/core.sh::finding_type_normalize (short `security` and long
# `security-vulnerability` both resolve to the same canonical id).
#
# TOTAL FUNCTION: unlike the lib/artifacts.sh generators (which return 2 on a
# missing/unreadable input), human_review_bucketize ALWAYS returns 0 and ALWAYS
# prints a valid JSON object — an empty / missing / unreadable / all-blank
# registry yields all-empty buckets, never an error.
set -uo pipefail

# _human_review_security_domains
#   Prints a JSON array of the security-ish domain ids (lowercased): every domain
#   in config/domains.json whose id matches /security/i. Data-driven so the
#   bucket-2 "security domain" predicate is not tied to one repo's layout (the
#   issue forbids hardcoding a single repo's domains). Falls back to the
#   documented static set {security, llm-security} when the config is missing,
#   unreadable, or unparseable. Pure; prints one line; never errors.

# human_review_bucketize <findings_jsonl_path>
#   Reads the JSON-Lines finding registry and prints a single deterministic JSON
#   object to stdout partitioning EVERY finding into 5 priority-ordered buckets,
#   first-match-wins, no double-counting. Writes nothing; invokes no model.
#
#   BUCKET SHAPE (research §5 D1 — the only shape satisfying BOTH the cap AC and
#   the "surplus not silently dropped" AC):
#     { "<bucket>": { "cap": <int|null>, "count": <N>, "items": [<full records>] } }
#   `cap` is the visible-slice size the renderer applies (items[:cap]); `count`
#   and `items` are NEVER truncated to the cap, so the held-back accounting issue
#   can recover the surplus (count - cap / items[cap:]). Items are full finding
#   records (both downstream consumers — the Markdown renderer and the html-report
#   agent — need the fields); the internal sort keys are stripped.
#
#   PRIORITY ORDER, first match wins:
#     1 top_critical_high              — any type; severity in {critical, high}.    cap 10, ranked.
#     2 top_medium_security            — severity==medium AND security-ish domain/type. cap 25, ranked.
#     3 test_quality                   — type in {test-gap, maintainability}.       own section.
#     4 not_actionable_without_scanner — type==external-dependency OR
#                                        (status==needs-validation AND scanner marker). own section.
#     5 remainder                      — everything else.
#
#   PREDICATE DETAILS:
#   - security-ish DOMAIN: .domain (lowercased) is in the data-driven security set
#     from config/domains.json (any id matching /security/i); see
#     _human_review_security_domains.
#   - security-ish TYPE: the type normalizes to "security-vulnerability" — matches
#     BOTH the short `security` and long `security-vulnerability` forms (the
#     short/long-form trap; mirrors lib/core.sh::finding_type_normalize).
#   - scanner marker: validation.suggested_validation contains "external scanner"
#     (case-insensitive) — the single load-bearing escalation phrase from
#     prompts/_base/audit.md, identical to lib/artifacts.sh P4.
#
#   ORDERING (all buckets, for determinism): severity rank desc (critical>high>
#   medium>low; unknown last), then confidence desc (null/non-numeric treated as
#   the 0.5 neutral midpoint), then id ascending as a stable tiebreak so output is
#   byte-identical across runs. This is the documented fallback, byte-identical to
#   how the sibling triage artifacts (TODO/NEEDS_REVIEW/DUPLICATES) order; it
#   coincides with the finding_risk_score product today (confidence is null for
#   every record -> 0.5 for all -> product preserves severity order).
#
#   ESCAPING: every field is emitted verbatim by jq, so a title containing
#   backticks / $(...) / pipes is data, never shell-evaluated.
#
#   EMPTY / MISSING / UNREADABLE / ALL-BLANK INPUT: all-empty buckets, rc 0
#   (a DELIBERATE divergence from the lib/artifacts.sh generators, which return 2;
#   this helper is a total function). Always returns 0.

# render_human_review_digest <run_id>
#   Renders the human-facing curated digest at logs/<run-id>/final/HUMAN_REVIEW.md
#   from the bucketed finding registry (final/findings.jsonl). This is the
#   CONSUMER of human_review_bucketize: it slices each bucket to its visible cap
#   and emits a single prioritized Markdown page in a fixed section order —
#   header (run id + totals), Top Critical/High, Top Medium Security,
#   Test & Quality (own section), Not actionable without a scanner (own section),
#   and the themed Remainder — every leftover (bucket-5) finding grouped by
#   `domain` into collapsed <details> blocks (count desc, then domain name), each
#   listing severity + lens + title + primary_location, under the `#remainder`
#   anchor. It RENDERS only — it never builds or mutates the registry and invokes
#   no model.
#
#   PATH RESOLUTION: honors $LOG_BASE when set (the live finalize call exports it;
#   tests set it to a temp dir), else <repo_root>/logs/<run_id>. So the test drives
#   the function by just setting LOG_BASE and dropping a fixture findings.jsonl.
#
#   ATOMIC WRITE: builds the document into <out>.tmp.$$ and `mv -f`s it into place
#   on success (the promote pattern from lib/synthesize.sh / lib/triage.sh). On a
#   render/IO failure the tmp file is removed and the function returns 1, leaving
#   NO partial HUMAN_REVIEW.md behind.
#
#   DEFENSIVE RENDER: a null/empty severity/domain/lens/primary_location renders
#   as an em dash via disp(), never the literal "null"; a null/empty markdown_path
#   emits NO link (never a broken "[]()"). Every field is emitted verbatim by jq,
#   so a title containing backticks / $(...) / pipes is data, never shell-evaluated
#   and never breaks a row (bullet-list layout, not a Markdown table).
#
#   EMPTY REGISTRY: an empty / missing findings.jsonl feeds all-empty buckets
#   (human_review_bucketize is total), so the digest renders a valid "nothing to
#   review" page (header + every section header with an empty-state note) and
#   returns 0.
#
#   Returns 0 on success (file written), 1 on a render/IO failure.

# human_review_heldback_summary <run_id>

#     Human review: 638 findings, 71 surfaced, 567 held back \
#       (critical/high +12, medium-security +43, remainder collapsed across 14 theme(s))
#
#   The numbers are sourced from human_review_bucketize's FULL ordered lists (the
#   bucketizer never truncates count/items to the cap), never re-derived from the
#   rendered Markdown, so they are exact. Reconciliation identity (always holds):
#     surfaced  = min(c1,cap1) + min(c2,cap2) + c3 + c4   (capped slices + the two
#                                                          uncapped own-sections)
#     held_back = (c1 - shown1) + (c2 - shown2) + c5        (cap surplus + the whole
#                                                          collapsed remainder)
#     surfaced + held_back == c1+c2+c3+c4+c5 == total       (shown_i + held_i == c_i)
#   The collapsed remainder counts as held-back (it is de-emphasized in the
#   digest), matching the issue's worked example. `themes` is the count of
#   distinct remainder `domain` groups (null/empty domain normalized to one group,
#   mirroring the renderer). When nothing is held back the line reports "0 held
#   back" and "no remainder" truthfully (AC4).
#
#   PURE: returns the message string on stdout; does NOT call log_info itself, so
#   it stays decoupled from lib/logging.sh and cannot trip the log_*-under-set -u
#   crash trap. The orchestrator (repolens.sh) owns the actual emission via
#   `log_info "$(human_review_heldback_summary ...)"`. Always returns 0; an empty /
#   missing registry yields "0 findings, 0 surfaced, 0 held back".
#
#   PATH RESOLUTION: identical to render_human_review_digest (honors $LOG_BASE,
#   else <repo_root>/logs/<run_id>), so finalize and tests address the same file.
