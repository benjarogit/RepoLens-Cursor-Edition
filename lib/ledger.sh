# RepoLens — evidence-ledger / finding-registry helpers.
#
# This module is sourceable; it defines functions only and has no top-level
# side effects. Nearly every function works purely from its arguments — so it
# is safe to source alone under `set -uo pipefail`. The sole exception is the
# `build_finding_registry` orchestrator, which reads the optional `LOG_BASE`
# and `OUTPUT_DIR` globals (both `${VAR:-}`-guarded) to resolve where the
# registry lands and where to find a local `--local` md tree.
#
# The finding registry (`logs/<run-id>/final/findings.jsonl`, schema in
# docs/finding-registry-schema.md) needs a STABLE `id` so the same finding
# earns the same id across runs and across both source paths (manifest
# clusters and `--local` markdown frontmatter). This module owns that id.
#
# NOTE: this is a DIFFERENT identity from the verifier's per-run
# `_round_digest_finding_id` (lib/rounds.sh): that one is SHA-1 over
# lens/domain/round/suspect-files for matching verification.json entries.
# The registry id below is title-derived (content-stable, not suspect-file
# derived) and carries an `fnd-` prefix to keep the two visually distinct.

# _ledger_normalize_title <title>
#   Normalizes a finding title for stable hashing: lowercases, strips an
#   optional leading "[severity]" prefix (only when the bracketed word is a
#   real severity), collapses non-alphanumeric runs to single spaces, trims.
#
#   Prefers the shared `_synthesize_normalize_title` (lib/synthesize.sh) when
#   it is already sourced, so the two stay in lockstep; otherwise falls back to
#   a self-contained replica so lib/ledger.sh works when sourced on its own.

# build_findings_jsonl_from_manifest <manifest_path> <out_jsonl_path>
#   Reads a validated synthesizer manifest (logs/<run-id>/final/manifest.json:
#   a JSON array of cluster objects) and writes the canonical finding registry
#   as JSON Lines — one record per cluster, mapped onto the 12-field schema in
#   docs/finding-registry-schema.md plus a source_finding_paths passthrough.
#
#   Pure: reads the manifest, writes the out file. No required globals;
#   severity_normalize (lib/core.sh) is used when present, else an inline
#   replica (see _ledger_severity_normalize) keeps this sourceable alone.
#
#   Field mapping (notable points):
#   - id        is content-derived via finding_id with an EMPTY primary_location
#               (the manifest carries no file:line); stable across runs.
#   - severity  is run through _ledger_severity_normalize (e.g. "High"->"high").
#   - status    defaults to "new"; verification_status "wrong" ->
#               "likely-false-positive", "stale" -> "needs-validation";
#               everything else (verified/unknown/absent) -> "new"
#               (conservative — "verified" is still "new" to the registry).
#   - duplicate_group is SEEDED from cluster_id; the final dedup grouping is
#               owned by the dedupe agent (#316/#322/#335). cluster_id is a
#               per-run, non-stable handle and must not be confused with id.
#   - type/confidence/markdown_path are null and primary_location is "";
#     validation is an empty object {}. These are owned by sibling agents.
#   - source_finding_paths is passed through verbatim so siblings can trace
#     the underlying evidence.
#
#   jq owns all quoting/escaping: the whole entry is handed to jq via
#   --argjson and fields are read inside jq, so titles/paths with quotes,
#   newlines, shell metacharacters, or unicode survive intact. Only the three
#   computed scalars (id, severity, status) are passed as --arg.
#
#   Empty manifest ([]) -> empty out file (0 lines), exit 0. Output is written
#   atomically (tmp + mv) so a mid-loop failure leaves no partial registry.
#   Returns non-zero on missing args, a missing manifest, or non-array JSON
#   (no output is written in those cases).

# build_findings_jsonl_from_local <output_dir> <out_jsonl_path>
#   Ingests the markdown findings written by `--local` mode into the canonical
#   finding registry as JSON Lines. Recursively finds every `*.md` under
#   <output_dir>, parses each file's leading YAML frontmatter
#   (title/severity/domain/lens) and emits one registry record per file that
#   carries a valid frontmatter block, mapped onto the 12-field schema in
#   docs/finding-registry-schema.md.
#
#   Sibling of build_findings_jsonl_from_manifest (#314): same null-slot
#   conventions and the same atomic-write + jq-owns-escaping discipline, with
#   two deliberate differences —
#   - markdown_path is POPULATED with the .md file's path (the point of #319:
#     link the registry row back to the human-readable file). The path is
#     emitted exactly as `find` yields it (i.e. relative to / prefixed by
#     <output_dir>), so it opens directly from where the registry lives.
#   - duplicate_group is null and source_finding_paths is OMITTED: local runs
#     have no synthesizer clusters, so there is nothing to seed or pass through.
#
#   Field sourcing:
#   - title/severity/domain/lens come from the frontmatter (YAML-dequoted).
#   - domain/lens fall back to directory components
#     (<output_dir>/<domain>/<lens>/NNN-x.md) ONLY when the frontmatter omits
#     them AND the nesting depth exists; a flat <output_dir>/NNN-x.md without
#     frontmatter domain/lens leaves them "" (no bogus value from the dir name).
#   - id is content-derived via finding_id over the DE-QUOTED title (no
#     primary_location), so the same finding earns the same id whether it
#     arrived via a manifest cluster or a local .md file.
#   - severity is run through _ledger_severity_normalize ("Critical"->"critical").
#   - type/confidence are null, primary_location is "", validation is {},
#     status is "new" (owned by sibling agents).
#
#   jq owns all quoting/escaping: title/domain/lens/markdown_path are passed as
#   --arg and the object is built inside jq, so titles with quotes, `$()`,
#   backticks, or unicode round-trip intact and are never shell-evaluated.
#
#   A file without a valid frontmatter block is skipped with a stderr warning
#   (not fatal — the function still returns 0). An empty / no-`.md` dir yields an
#   empty output file (0 lines), exit 0. find output is sorted so rebuilds are
#   byte-identical. Output is written atomically (tmp + mv). Returns non-zero on
#   missing args or a missing <output_dir>, and on a missing out-path parent dir

# build_findings_csv <findings_jsonl_path> <out_csv_path>
#   Projects the canonical finding registry (findings.jsonl, schema in
#   docs/finding-registry-schema.md) onto a flat CSV: a fixed 12-column header
#   row, then one row per JSONL line, preserving JSONL line order
#   (deterministic). Spreadsheet/grep users get a flat view without a second
#   source of truth — findings.jsonl stays the full-fidelity registry.
#
#   Columns (exactly, in this order):
#     id,title,severity,type,domain,lens,status,primary_location,confidence,
#     duplicate_group,markdown_path,complexity
#   The nested `validation` object and the `source_finding_paths` array are
#   OMITTED — they don't flatten to a single cell. Keep this column list in
#   lockstep with the jq array below; the header string and the array are two
#   parallel lists (tests/test_ledger_csv.sh asserts the header byte-for-byte).
#
#   jq -r @csv owns all CSV quoting/escaping (RFC-4180): a field containing a
#   comma, a double quote, or a newline is correctly quoted and inner quotes are
#   doubled. A JSON null (or an absent key) renders as a bare empty cell.
#   Numbers (e.g. confidence) render unquoted. Fields are read inside jq, so
#   titles with shell metacharacters or unicode are never shell-evaluated.
#
#   Sibling of build_findings_jsonl_from_{manifest,local}: same atomic-write
#   (tmp + mv) + jq-owns-escaping discipline. Pure: reads the JSONL, writes the
#   CSV. An empty findings.jsonl yields a header-only CSV (matching the empty,
#   zero-line registry), exit 0. Returns non-zero on missing args or a missing
#   input file (no output written), and on a jq/IO failure (tmp cleaned up).

# validate_findings_jsonl <findings_jsonl_path>
#   Validates the JSON-Lines finding registry (schema:
#   docs/finding-registry-schema.md) PER LINE. This is the last line of defense
#   so siblings (dedupe/validation/triage/html/csv) can trust the structure even
#   if a builder regresses or a future producer writes the file. It mirrors
#   validate_manifest's reporting discipline (every message to stderr, prefixed
#   "validate_findings_jsonl: ...", accumulate-then-return), but iterates line by
#   line because JSONL is one independent JSON object per line: a single jq pass
#   would abort on the first malformed line, skip every line after it, and could
#   not attribute a violation to a line number.
#
#   Per non-empty line it asserts: the line parses as a JSON object; the 12
#   required keys are present (id, title, severity, type, domain, lens, status,
#   primary_location, confidence, duplicate_group, markdown_path, validation); id
#   is a non-empty string; severity in {critical,high,medium,low}; status in
#   {new,duplicate,needs-validation,likely-false-positive}; a non-null, non-empty
#   type in {security,reliability,performance,maintainability,test-gap,
#   external-dependency} (null/empty type accepted — owned by finding-types);
#   validation is an object (internals NOT checked — owned by validation-hints).
#   Extra/forward-compatible keys (e.g. source_finding_paths) are tolerated.
#
#   Empty file -> 0. Returns 0 when every line is valid, 1 on any violation,
#   2 on missing arg / missing file. Pure: reads only, no writes, no model.

# build_finding_registry <run_id> [local_dir]
#   Orchestrates the four source-specific builders above into the canonical
#   finding registry under `<log_base>/final/`: findings.jsonl (full fidelity)
#   plus findings.csv (flat projection). This is the single producer of
#   final/findings.jsonl — consumed by result_pointer.sh / human_review.sh /
#   triage. It is GLUE ONLY; no new parsing logic lives here.
#
#   Source selection (both may run, results are concatenated):
#   - if `<log_base>/final/manifest.json` exists, ingest it via
#     build_findings_jsonl_from_manifest.
#   - if a local output dir is supplied (2nd arg, else the OUTPUT_DIR global)
#     and is a directory, ingest its `*.md` tree via
#     build_findings_jsonl_from_local.
#   The concatenation is then collapsed so each `id` appears once, keeping the
#   FIRST occurrence (manifest-first tie-break — the manifest record carries the
#   richer cross-run provenance: source_finding_paths passthrough and a
#   cluster-seeded duplicate_group. Either order satisfies the AC, which mandates
#   only that identical-id duplicates collapse). jq -s + reduce is single-pass
#   and order-preserving (unique_by would sort and lose "keep first").
#
#   Atomicity mirrors run_synthesizer's tmp+mv discipline: the registry is
#   assembled in a `.tmp.$$` candidate, validated via validate_findings_jsonl,
#   and only `mv`-ed into place on success. A validation (or builder) failure
#   discards every intermediate and promotes NOTHING — a partial/failed build
#   never leaves a consumable findings.jsonl. The CSV is derived from the
#   PROMOTED jsonl, so no orphan CSV survives a discarded candidate.
#
#   No sources -> a canonical-empty registry: a 0-line findings.jsonl and a
#   header-only findings.csv, exit 0 (parity with the synthesizer's empty case).
#
#   Reads the optional LOG_BASE and OUTPUT_DIR globals (both `${VAR:-}`-guarded).
#   Returns 2 on a missing run_id, 1 on a builder/jq/IO/validation failure.
