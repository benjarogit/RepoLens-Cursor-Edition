# RepoLens — triage dispatcher and context-pack writer.
#
# Implements the pre-rounds round-0 context pack from issue #171. Composes the
# triage prompt from prompts/_base/triage.md, dispatches the active agent
# exactly once, captures its markdown stdout, truncates the pack to the 2 KB
# budget, and atomically promotes it to
# logs/<run-id>/triage/context-pack.md. The full agent transcript is preserved
# at logs/<run-id>/triage/transcript.txt for forensic recovery.
#
# Triage runs ONCE before run_rounds; on every failure path the dispatcher
# returns non-zero but the orchestrator should treat that as non-fatal: a
# missing context-pack.md means round-1 lenses do their own initial scan.
#
# This module is sourceable; it defines functions only and has no top-level
# side effects beyond loading shared helpers.

# Maximum byte size of the consumable context pack. Anything beyond this is
# truncated by _triage_truncate_pack with a deterministic marker so downstream
# tooling can detect that truncation happened.

# _triage_truncate_pack <src_path> <dst_path>
#   Copies up to TRIAGE_PACK_MAX_BYTES from <src_path> into <dst_path>. If the
#   source exceeds the cap, the destination is truncated and a deterministic
#   marker line is appended so downstream readers can detect truncation. The
#   truncation budget is enforced byte-wise on the consumable pack only; the
#   full original transcript is preserved separately by run_triage.

# run_triage <run_id>
#   Composes the triage prompt, invokes the active agent exactly once, captures
#   stdout, truncates it to TRIAGE_PACK_MAX_BYTES, and atomically promotes it
#   to logs/<run-id>/triage/context-pack.md. The full transcript is also
#   written to logs/<run-id>/triage/transcript.txt.
#
#   Idempotent on resume: if context-pack.md already exists for this run id
#   the function returns 0 without re-invoking the agent.
#
#   Required globals: AGENT, PROJECT_PATH.
#   Optional globals: REPO_OWNER, REPO_NAME, MODE, LOG_BASE, BUG_REPORT_FILE,
#                     AGENT_TIMEOUT_SECS, AGENT_KILL_GRACE_SECS.
#
#   Returns 0 on success, non-zero on any dispatch / composition failure. The
#   orchestrator must treat non-zero as non-fatal — bugreport mode continues
#   with an absent context pack (which the template engine substitutes as
#   empty into the round-1 lens prompts).
