# Coverage tests for issue #375 — the two pure resolvers that feed
# attempts.json (and, for the exit code, the real process exit ladder):
#   - resolve_run_exit_code   (repolens.sh) — maps the resolved run state to the
#                             process exit code that BOTH attempts.json.exit_code
#                             and the exit ladder use, so they can never drift.
#   - resolve_why_stopped     (repolens.sh) — prefers summary.json.stopped_reason
#                             and, when empty, falls back to whichever abort
#                             sentinel is on disk (or interrupted-<signal>).
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (gap analysis vs. the #375 tests already in the tree):
#   tests/test_attempts_stop_reason.sh drives repolens.sh end-to-end and only
#   reaches the LENS rate-limit branch (exit 3, why_stopped from a present
#   stopped_reason) and the clean-finish branch (exit 0). The remaining branches
#   of BOTH resolvers are unexercised:
#     resolve_run_exit_code:  interrupted -> $REPOLENS_INTERRUPT_EXIT_CODE,
#       phase rate-limit -> 1, agent-no-progress/systemic -> 1, rounds-rc
#       passthrough, broken-health -> 2 (+ the degenerate override -> 0), and
#       the branch ORDERING (interrupted and rate-limit win over later branches).
#     resolve_why_stopped:    the entire sentinel FALLBACK ladder
#       (rate-limit / agent-no-progress / systemic-failure / interrupted-<sig>)
#       fires only when stopped_reason is empty — a path the integration test
#       (which always carries stopped_reason "rate-limited") never hits. The
#       #375 test-dev summary explicitly left this fallback "to code review".
#
# Both resolvers are PURE (no side effects), so we exercise the REAL production
# code by extracting the contiguous helper block from the live repolens.sh and
# sourcing it — the same extract-and-source convention as
# tests/test_forge_warn_dedup.sh:323. No copy of the logic lives in this test,
# so the asserts track repolens.sh automatically. NO real model is involved.

# The control globals below (REPOLENS_FINAL_STATE, REPOLENS_INTERRUPT_EXIT_CODE,
# RUN_ROUNDS_RC, RUN_HEALTH, REPOLENS_ALLOW_DEGENERATE) are read by the resolver
# functions sourced from repolens.sh at runtime; ShellCheck cannot follow that
# source boundary and flags them as unused.
