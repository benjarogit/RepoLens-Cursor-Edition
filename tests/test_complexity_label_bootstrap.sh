# Tests for issue #385 — the FORGE half of task-complexity routing: the
# `ensure_labels` (repolens.sh) pre-creation gate for the
# `repolens/complexity/<n>` labels. The registry half (parse/store/project/
# validate) is covered by test_ledger_complexity.sh; this file covers the label
# bootstrap, which lives inside repolens.sh and had a real, previously-DENIED
# defect: the gate must pre-create the five complexity labels ONLY for the audit
# and bugreport modes whose prompts (audit.md, synthesize.md) actually instruct
# an agent to APPLY a `repolens/complexity/<n>` label. Every other mode
# references complexity zero times, so creating the labels there would litter the
# target repo with five unused labels per run.
#
# repolens.sh runs `main` at top level (no source guard), so it cannot be sourced
# to reach ensure_labels. Instead we EXTRACT the real function verbatim (the
# established repo alternative is a static grep, but that cannot verify the GATE —
# which modes get the labels — which is the exact axis that regressed). We source
# the extracted bytes and drive them with stubbed externals (log_info/die/
# forge_label_bootstrap) plus the globals ensure_labels reads. The stub captures
# the newline-delimited `label=color` bootstrap file BEFORE ensure_labels removes
# it, so we can assert exactly which labels the run would create. NO AI models are
# invoked — pure bash/jq, per CLAUDE.md.
