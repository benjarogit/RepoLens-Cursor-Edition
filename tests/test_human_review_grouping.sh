# Tests for issue #350: group the themed Remainder (bucket 5) by domain into
# collapsed <details> sections with per-group counts in HUMAN_REVIEW.md.
# Pure-function tests only; NO AI models are invoked — every input is a
# handwritten JSON-Lines fixture and the renderer is pure jq + bash.
#
# Contract under test (issue acceptance criteria + research):
#
#   render_human_review_digest <run_id> renders the Remainder section so that
#   every bucket-5 finding appears under exactly one `domain` (theme) group,
#   each group a GitHub <details><summary>domain — N finding(s)</summary>…</details>
#   block collapsed by default. Groups are ordered by finding count descending,
#   then domain name ascending, for byte-identical determinism. A section total
#   line ("Other findings: N across M theme(s)") is shown. A null/empty domain
#   renders via an em dash (never the literal "null"). A zero remainder renders
#   cleanly with NO <details> blocks. Findings from buckets 1–4 never leak into
#   the remainder (membership is owned by the out-of-scope bucketizer).
