# Tests for issue #349: ensure --local runs produce findings.jsonl + findings.csv.
#
# --local mode bypasses the synthesizer/manifest path entirely (the
# synthesizer/filing block is gated on bugreport && rounds>1, and the non-local
# finding-registry hook is `! $LOCAL_MODE`-gated — sibling issue #348). So today a
# --local run dumps NNN-<slug>.md files into $OUTPUT_DIR with NO machine-readable
# index. This issue adds the missing producer glue: a $LOCAL_MODE-gated, NON-FATAL
# call to build_finding_registry "$RUN_ID" "$OUTPUT_DIR" in the finalize region,
# plus an end-of-run summary line naming the index — so a --local run also emits
# logs/<run-id>/final/findings.jsonl + findings.csv indexing the md tree.
#
# The orchestrator (lib/ledger.sh::build_finding_registry + its local-md ingestion
# path) already ships and is fully unit-tested (tests/test_ledger_build_registry.sh,
# tests/test_ledger_from_local.sh). The NEW surface this issue adds is purely the
# wiring in repolens.sh, so that is what these tests pin.
#
# Acceptance criteria (issue #349):
#   1. After a --local run, final/findings.jsonl + findings.csv exist and index the
#      md files (each record's markdown_path points at a real md file).
#   2. The registry lands under final/, leaving $OUTPUT_DIR holding only md files.
#   3. A build failure is NON-FATAL (warn, run still succeeds).
#   4. The end-of-run local-mode summary mentions the registry index path.
#
# Strategy (CLAUDE.md hard rule: NO real models — mock-agent / sourced replica only):
#   Part A — full mock-agent --local run inside an isolated symlink-farm logs tree.
#            Proves the wiring actually fires in the real finalize path: the
#            registry is produced under final/, every markdown_path resolves to a
#            real md file, $OUTPUT_DIR stays md-only, and the run surfaces the index
#            path. This is the genuine red-phase driver (no findings.jsonl today).
#   Part B — sourced replica of the new $LOCAL_MODE guard with build_finding_registry
#            shadowed to FAIL, pinning the MANDATORY non-fatal contract (rc 0, run
#            state untouched, warn branch fired). A passing stub would never exercise
#            the `|| log_warn` branch this AC is about.
#   Part C — static wiring assertions: repolens.sh carries a $LOCAL_MODE-gated,
#            OUTPUT_DIR-aware, non-fatal build_finding_registry call distinct from
#            the existing `! $LOCAL_MODE` block.
